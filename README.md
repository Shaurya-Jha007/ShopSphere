## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Dynamic Data Fetching**:
   - Sanity.io Backend:
      Product data, including images, descriptions, categories, and prices, is fetched dynamically from a Sanity.io backend.
   - Updates in the backend are reflected in real-time on the website.

2. **Shopping Basket**:
   - Users can:
   - Add products to their basket from product listings or individual product pages.
   - View the basket and manage quantities directly from the Basket page.
   - Items in the basket are persisted across sessions using localStorage.
     
3. **Payments with Stripe**:
   - Checkout Process:
   - When the user proceeds to checkout, a session is created via Stripe's API.
   - Stripe handles payment securely, redirecting users to a payment page.
   - Upon successful payment, the user is redirected back to the platform with a confirmation.
   
4. **Categorization and Navigation**:
   - The platform organizes products into intuitive categories fetched from Sanity.io.
   - A responsive navigation bar and a search bar allow users to filter products quickly.
   
5. **User-Friendly Product Pages**:
   - Each product page displays:
   - High-quality product images.
   - Product details like price, description, and availability.
   - Add-to-basket functionality.
   
6. **Deployment**:
   - The app is deployed on Vercel for production.
   - With Next.js, server-side rendering ensures optimal performance for dynamic content, while static assets are served efficiently.
